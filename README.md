There are a lot of algorithms developed for flight delay prediction, however,  for taxi-in time, it seems that no one has worked on it before. Taxi-in is the time duration elapsed between wheels-on and gate arrival at the destination airport. This information is actually very important and useful for the airport to prepare for the landing, wisely dispatch the airport runway for each flight.
Herein, our objective is to try using four different prediction models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree model with gradient boosting, and artificial neural network, to predict the taxi-in time using the history data and compare the results.
